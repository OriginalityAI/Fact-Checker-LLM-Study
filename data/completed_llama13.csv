While these factors may contribute to some extent, there are other factors at play as well. According to the World Economic Outlook (WEO) report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for 2023, Switzerland has one of the highest GDP per capita in the world, which suggests that the country's strong economy does not necessarily lead to high food prices. Additionally, the WEO report states that Switzerland's agricultural sector is relatively small compared to other European countries, which implies that the limited arable land may not be as significant a factor as suggested. Furthermore, the IMF's Consumer Price Index (CPI) manual indicates that taxes and tariffs on food products in Switzerland are not particularly high compared to other countries.

According to the National Geographic Education article on renewable energy (<https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/renewable-energy/>), geothermal energy is generated by harnessing the heat from the Earth's core, while hydroelectric power is generated by using the energy of moving water. These sources of energy do not rely on the sun for their power","['https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/renewable-energy/', 'https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/renewable-energy/5th-grade/', 'https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-environmentalbiology/chapter/11-3-renewable-energy-sources/']",,
